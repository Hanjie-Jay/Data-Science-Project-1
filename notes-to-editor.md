# Notes to editor

## Style guidelines relevant to the [submission](/reports/02242799-submission.pdf)

- Chart typography: The typeface, size, and colour of different chart compositions

- Chart parts: The chart size with the format of the corresponding compositions, such as title, axis, label, etc.

- Color: The selection of colour for components in the chart

- Line charts: When and how to use the line charts, including the style tips and notes

- Graphs: When and how to use the graphs

## Guideline met and not met

### Met

The chart typography and colour fully met. All the texts and charts of my submission followed the guideline. The line chart satisfied the chart parts requirement, while the graph chart fulfilled most of them. Both line and graph charts met the majority of their usage tips.

### Not met

The chart size in the submission file is different from the original. Different figure number type.

- Line chart: There are 5 lines in the chart, while it is suggested to be less than 4

- Graph chart: The output width is not 6.5 inches as the graph contains 50 sub-charts and needs more space. No urban Tagline, as the `urbn_plot()` function conflicts with `facet_geo()`. The y-axises are not starting from 0.

- How to write a better corresponding analysis for the data visualisation more effectively and engagingly?

- How to choose which data to visualise when facing a massive database, and how to clean them more effectively?
